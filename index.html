        <p>The line-storm clouds fly tattered and swift,</p>
        <p>The road is forlorn all day,</p>
        <p>Where a myriad snowy quartz stones lift,</p>
        <p>And the hoof-prints vanish away.</p>
        <p>The roadside flowers, too wet for the bee,</p>
        <p>Expend their bloom in vain.</p>
        <p>Come over the hills and far with me,</p>
        <p>And be my love in the rain.</p>
        <p>The birds have less to say for themselves</p>
        <p>In the wood-world’s torn despair</p>
        <p>Than now these numberless years the elves,</p>
        <p>Although they are no less there</p>
        <p>All song of the woods is crushed like some</p> 
            <p>Wild, easily shattered rose.</p> 
          <p>Come, be my love in the wet woods; come,</p>
            <p>Where the boughs rain when it blows.</p> 
          
          <p>There is the gale to urge behind</p> 
            <p>And bruit our singing down,</p> 
          <p>And the shallow waters aflutter with wind</p> 
            <p>From which to gather your gown.</p>    
          <p>What matter if we go clear to the west,</p> 
            <p>And come not through dry-shod?</p> 
          <p>For wilding brooch shall wet your breast</p> 
            <p>The rain-fresh goldenrod.</p> 
          
          <p>Oh, never this whelming east wind swells</p>   
            <p>But it seems like the sea’s return</p> 
          <p>To the ancient lands where it left the shells</p> 
            <p>Before the age of the fern;</p> 
          <p>And it seems like the time when after doubt</p> 
            <p>Our love came back amain.</p>      
          <p>Oh, come forth into the storm and rout</p> 
            <p>And be my love in the rain.</p>
